BEFORE ZIPPING - Files/Folders to EXCLUDE to reduce size:

Frontend:
- planncomm-frontend/node_modules  (DELETE or EXCLUDE - 300+ MB)
- planncomm-frontend/build         (DELETE or EXCLUDE if exists)

Backend:
- planncomm-backend/node_modules   (DELETE or EXCLUDE - 100+ MB)
- planncomm-backend/dist          (DELETE or EXCLUDE if exists)

These will be recreated with 'npm install' on the other laptop.

IMPORTANT - KEEP THESE:
✅ planncomm-backend/database/planncomm.db (Your 380 tasks!)
✅ All src folders
✅ All package.json files
✅ README-DEMO.md
✅ START-DEMO.bat

Final zip should be < 5 MB instead of 400+ MB
