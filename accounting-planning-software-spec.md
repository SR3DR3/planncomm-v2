# Modern Accounting Planning Software Specification

## Core System Architecture Requirements

### Data Integrity & Temporal Consistency
- **Point-in-time data architecture**: All data modifications must be timestamped with effective dates to prevent future-leak in reporting
- **Immutable audit trail**: Historical data cannot be modified; only new versions with timestamps can be created
- **Transaction isolation**: Ensure ACID compliance for all financial operations
- **Temporal validation**: Prevent entry of future-dated transactions beyond configurable threshold

## Module 1: Client Management System

### Client Master Data
- **Core Information**:
  - Client ID (auto-generated, immutable)
  - Company name with version history
  - Contact person details
  - Multiple address types (billing, correspondence, physical)
  - Tax identifiers (BTW/VAT number, KvK/Chamber of Commerce)
  - Industry classification (culture/sector)
  - Office/department assignment

### Contact Management
- Primary and secondary contact persons
- Multiple phone numbers with types (general, fax, mobile)
- Email addresses with validation
- Preferred communication channels
- Document delivery preferences (e-mail with BCC options)

### Client Categorization
- Active/inactive status with effective dates
- Client type (Hulst, Koewacht, Nieuw-Namen, St. Jansteen)
- Service level agreements
- Custom tags and classifications

## Module 2: Task & Project Management

### Task Definition System
- **Task Templates**:
  - RA (Audit/Review assignments)
  - Tax filings (OB monthly/quarterly, BTW, ICP)
  - Payroll processing (Loonheffing monthly/yearly)
  - Annual accounts (Jaarwerk)
  - Advisory services (Bespr., Review)
  - Secretarial services

### Task Scheduling Engine
- **Temporal Planning**:
  - Multi-year planning capability (current: 2025 view)
  - Monthly, quarterly, and annual recurring tasks
  - Dependency management between tasks
  - Critical path calculation
  - Resource leveling algorithms

### Time Allocation Matrix
- Hours budgeting per task per period
- Planned vs. actual tracking
- Automatic rollover of incomplete tasks
- Capacity planning with 8-hour workday default
- Overtime and undertime tracking

## Module 3: Resource Management

### Employee/Resource Planning
- **Capacity Management**:
  - Available hours calculation (Total uren)
  - Non-billable hours tracking (Bedrijfsvrije uren)
  - Billable hours targets
  - Utilization rate calculations
  - Department-based resource pools

### Workload Distribution
- Automatic task assignment based on:
  - Employee expertise matrix
  - Current workload
  - Client preferences
  - Historical performance

## Module 4: Financial Planning & Reporting

### Budget Management
- **Hour-based Budgeting**:
  - Standard rates per task type
  - Client-specific rate cards
  - Budget vs. actual variance analysis
  - Percentage completion tracking

### Performance Metrics
- Realization rates
- Write-offs and write-ups
- Profitability by client/task/employee
- Trend analysis with seasonal adjustments

## Module 5: Status & Workflow Management

### Task Status Tracking
- **Visual Status Indicators**:
  - Color-coded progress (yellow/green dots system)
  - Status categories (Onderhanden, Verzonden, Eindreview)
  - Completion percentages
  - Due date monitoring

### Workflow Automation
- Configurable approval chains
- Automatic status transitions
- Notification triggers
- Escalation procedures

## Module 6: Advanced Features for Modernization

### Real-time Analytics Dashboard
- **Key Performance Indicators**:
  - Daily/weekly/monthly snapshots
  - Predictive workload analysis
  - Bottleneck identification
  - Client profitability heat maps

### Integration Capabilities
- REST API for third-party integrations
- Import/export functionality (CSV, Excel, XML)
- Document management system integration
- Email automation with templates

### Compliance & Security
- GDPR-compliant data handling
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Field-level encryption for sensitive data
- Automated backup and disaster recovery

### Machine Learning Enhancements
- **Predictive Analytics**:
  - Task duration estimation based on historical data
  - Client churn prediction
  - Optimal resource allocation suggestions
  - Anomaly detection in time entries

### Mobile & Cloud Features
- Progressive Web App (PWA) for mobile access
- Real-time synchronization
- Offline capability with conflict resolution
- Multi-tenant cloud architecture

## Technical Implementation Considerations

### Database Design
- **Temporal Tables**: Use system-versioned temporal tables for audit trails
- **Partitioning**: Implement table partitioning by year for performance
- **Indexing Strategy**: Clustered indexes on commonly queried date ranges
- **Data Retention**: Configurable retention policies with archival procedures

### Performance Optimization
- Lazy loading for large datasets
- Pagination with cursor-based navigation
- Query optimization with execution plan analysis
- Caching strategy for frequently accessed data

### User Interface Improvements
- Modern, responsive design replacing legacy Windows forms
- Drag-and-drop task scheduling
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users
- Customizable dashboards per user role
- Dark mode support

### Reporting Engine
- Real-time report generation
- Scheduled report distribution
- Custom report builder with drag-and-drop
- Export to multiple formats (PDF, Excel, CSV)

## Migration Strategy
1. Data mapping from legacy system
2. Historical data preservation with read-only access
3. Parallel run period for validation
4. Phased rollout by department/office
5. Comprehensive user training program

## Success Metrics
- Reduce time spent on administrative tasks by 40%
- Improve resource utilization to 85%+
- Decrease reporting generation time by 60%
- Achieve 99.9% system availability
- Enable real-time decision making with live dashboards
