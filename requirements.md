# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for modernizing the existing PlannComm planning software. The modernized version will maintain all current functionality while adding new integrations with PowerBI and Dynamics, Excel export capabilities, and a refreshed professional UI suitable for accounting firms. The system currently handles task-based hour planning per company, where different employees are assigned to specific tasks (quarterly administration, BTW/ICP filings, salaries, annual accounts). The key challenge is that hours are planned in PlannComm but actual hours are tracked in Dynamics, making planned vs actual comparison inefficient at scale. The modernized system will address this through seamless integration and automated reporting capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an accounting firm user, I want to access all existing task-based planning functionality in a modernized interface, so that I can continue planning hours per company and task with improved usability and visual appeal.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application launches THEN the system SHALL display a modern, professional interface that maintains all current module functionality
2. WHEN a user navigates between modules (Werknemer, Klant, Overzichten, Systeem beheer) THEN the system SHALL provide the same functionality as the legacy system
3. WHEN a user performs client management tasks THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing client data fields and operations
4. WHEN a user creates or modifies task-based planning data THEN the system SHALL preserve all current planning capabilities including task assignment to specific employees
5. IF a user accesses planning features THEN the system SHALL display task breakdowns (quarterly admin, BTW/ICP filings, salaries, annual accounts) with assigned employees

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an accounting professional, I want to connect the planning software to PowerBI, so that I can create planned vs actual hour analysis dashboards and scale our performance monitoring efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user configures PowerBI integration THEN the system SHALL establish a secure connection to PowerBI services
2. WHEN planning data is updated THEN the system SHALL synchronize planned hours by task and employee to PowerBI datasets
3. WHEN combined with Dynamics actual hours data THEN the system SHALL enable planned vs actual hour comparison reporting in PowerBI
4. IF PowerBI connection fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages and retry mechanisms
5. WHEN data is synchronized THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity and provide real-time or near-real-time updates for performance analysis

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an accounting firm user, I want to integrate with Microsoft Dynamics, so that I can automatically compare planned hours from PlannComm with actual hours tracked in Dynamics without manual effort.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user configures Dynamics integration THEN the system SHALL establish secure API connections to Dynamics 365
2. WHEN employees log actual hours in Dynamics THEN the system SHALL retrieve this data and match it to planned tasks and employees
3. WHEN client data is modified THEN the system SHALL synchronize changes bidirectionally with Dynamics
4. IF synchronization conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL provide conflict resolution mechanisms with clear task and employee mapping
5. WHEN integration is active THEN the system SHALL enable real-time planned vs actual hour variance reporting

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a planning professional, I want to export planning data to Excel, so that I can perform additional analysis and share reports with stakeholders who prefer Excel format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects export to Excel THEN the system SHALL generate Excel files with properly formatted data
2. WHEN exporting planning data THEN the system SHALL maintain all formatting, formulas, and data relationships
3. WHEN exporting Gantt charts THEN the system SHALL preserve visual timeline representations in Excel format
4. IF export includes financial data THEN the system SHALL maintain numerical precision and currency formatting
5. WHEN export is complete THEN the system SHALL provide download options and success confirmation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an accounting firm manager, I want the software to maintain a professional appearance consistent with our firm's standards, so that it integrates seamlessly with our professional environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is displayed THEN the system SHALL use a clean, modern design language appropriate for professional services
2. WHEN users interact with the interface THEN the system SHALL provide intuitive navigation and consistent visual hierarchy
3. WHEN displaying data tables and forms THEN the system SHALL use professional typography and spacing standards
4. IF the interface includes branding elements THEN the system SHALL allow customization to match firm branding
5. WHEN accessed on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL maintain professional appearance and usability

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a planning manager, I want a modular task system that allows easy addition of tasks to companies and connection to relevant employees, so that I can efficiently manage diverse accounting workflows with different specialist assignments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding tasks to a company THEN the system SHALL provide a modular interface to easily create and configure task types (quarterly admin, BTW aangifte, ICP aangifte, salaries, jaarrekening)
2. WHEN assigning employees to tasks THEN the system SHALL allow flexible assignment of different employees to different task types within the same company
3. WHEN planning hours THEN the system SHALL support task-specific hour allocation with employee-specific assignments
4. IF task templates are needed THEN the system SHALL provide reusable task templates for common accounting workflows
5. WHEN viewing company planning THEN the system SHALL display clear task breakdown with assigned employees and planned hours

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a power user, I want enhanced functionality beyond the current system, so that I can work more efficiently and access advanced features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing data entry THEN the system SHALL provide improved validation and auto-completion features
2. WHEN searching for information THEN the system SHALL offer advanced search and filtering capabilities
3. WHEN working with large datasets THEN the system SHALL provide better performance and pagination
4. IF users need bulk operations THEN the system SHALL support batch processing and bulk updates
5. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL offer more flexible report customization options

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to ensure data security and compliance with a local PostgreSQL database installation, so that our firm meets professional standards and regulatory requirements without Docker dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access the system THEN the system SHALL implement role-based access controls

3. WHEN user activities occur THEN the system SHALL maintain comprehensive audit logs
4. IF security incidents are detected THEN the system SHALL provide alerting and incident response capabilities
5. WHEN handling client data THEN the system SHALL comply with relevant data protection regulations
6. WHEN setting up the database THEN the system SHALL work with a locally installed PostgreSQL instance without requiring Docker containers
